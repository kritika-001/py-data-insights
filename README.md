This repository contains a Python project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The project involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and making the dataset ready for analysis.
Additionally, it includes various statistical representations such as maps, visualizations, and other charts to help uncover meaningful insights from the data.
The goal of this project is to showcase how EDA can be used to explore datasets effectively, identify trends, and present findings through clear visualizations.
